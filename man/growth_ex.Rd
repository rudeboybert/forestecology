\title{Example growth data frame for small example}
\format{
A \code{sf} spatial tibble
\describe{
\item{ID}{Tree identification number. This identifies an individual tree and
can be used to connect trees between the two censuses.}
\item{sp}{Species of the individual}
\item{codes1}{Code for additional information on the stem during the first census: M means the main stem
of the individual tree and R means the stem was lost, but the tag was moved to another stem greater than DBH cutoff,
this stands for resprout.}
\item{dbh1}{Diameter at breast height of the tree in cm at the first census}
\item{dbh2}{Diameter at breast height of the tree in cm at the second census}
\item{growth}{Average annual growth between the two censuses in cm per year}
\item{codes2}{Codes at the second census}
\item{geometry}{Point location of the individual}
}

\usage{
growth_ex
}
\description{
This is an example growth data frame formed from two census data frames. In this case it is
made by combining \code{\link{census_1_ex}} and \code{\link{census_2_ex}}. The
individuals alive in both censuses were linked by their tree ID.
