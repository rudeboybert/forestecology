Description: Code for fitting and assessing models for the growth of trees. In 
    particular for the Bayesian neighborhood competition linear regression model 
    of Allen (2020): methods for model fitting and generating fitted/predicted 
    values, evaluating the effect of competitor species identity using 
    permutation tests, and evaluating model performance using spatial 
    cross-validation.
