# Resubmission

With blockCV being resubmitted and back on CRAN I am submitting this package as well.

## Test environments

-   local macOS install, R 4.5.1
-   win-builder (release, devel, oldrel)

## R CMD check results

NOTES:

-   Interspecific (4:9) flagged as spelling error, when it isn't
-   The R precheck complains that "Author field differs from that derived from Authors\@R". We checked it and the behavior is ok. It is just that the naming of affiliation and ORCID leads to slightly different formatting when returned, but the information stays the same.
